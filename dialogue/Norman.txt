Well... ain't you a sight.
See a lotta sights in these times...
Faces comin' and goin', the wind comin' and blowin'...
Why don'tcha take a seat~?
Don't gimme that sour face!
I'm not goin' anywhere.

Havin' fun, arent'cha?
'Bout time I caught'cher eye~
Might as well get used to it...
I'm not goin' anywhere.

Name's Norman.

You've got a knack for makin' them's dungeons, don'tcha~?
Heh, I know it all too well.
Be a real shame if somethin' were to HAPPEN to them, heh...
That's why I'm here.
If you wanna SAVE your levels from being forgotten,
you'll wanna press CTRL + S so I'll know when to write it all down.
From there, I'll come back and slip it into one of these here shelves.

Gee, that sure is a nice dungeon you're buildin'...
But if you take a break for a while, well it ain't gon' be here the next time, HA~!
That's why I'm here.
When you're ready - no pressure;
I'll write 'yer stuff down so you can remember it the next time.
With a simple tap of CTRL + S, I'll send 'yer levels to the Library.
